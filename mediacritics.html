            <p>
                Initially, I found it quite hard to get into this show. The rapid editing is definitely something you will have<br>
                to get used to, same as the general pacing. When I started this show about a year ago, I was pretty overwhelmed<br>
                by this. I usually like slower paced movies and shows that give the viewer time to breathe. This show is pretty<br>
                much the opposite of that. Now, after rewatching it, I have to admit to myself that I was wrong. Such a fast pace<br>
                <b>can</b> work. It does not feel gimmicky, or as if you are just trying to stimulate the viewer. Why? I think it<br>
                is because it seems "authentic" to the environment the show takes place in for the most part. Since the entire<br>
                first episode (as far as I can recall) takes place in the kitchen, the fast pace makes sense. But not all of this<br>
                show involves the kitchen. There are slower, character driven moments that take place outside. There, the pacing<br>
                is drastically reduced. Sadly, we only come across these moments from the second episode onwards, giving the<br>
                false impression that the whole show will be none stop fast paced, at least to the people who stop after the<br>
                first episode, like I did.<br><br>
                That aside though, I think this show looks absolutely incredible. Maybe it is because I am from a small town<br>
                and have barely been to any big cities, but I love how they portray Chicago in this show, with the trains, the<br>
                industrial sites, alleyways etc.<br>
                There are also a lot of beautiful shots with natural lighting, like at the start (and end) of episode 3, with<br>
                Carmy at the beach gazing at the Sunrise.<br><br>
                Character development is also done to perfection. Let us examine the character of Tina, as an example for this:<br>
                She starts off being very much against Carmy's attemps to reinnovate the restaurant, even going as far as to<br>
                sabotage his workspace. She also does not respect Syndey at all. All of this, added onto the fact that she is<br>
                pretty much working against the desires of not only Carmy, but also the viewer, has made me hate her like no<br>
                other character during the first few episodes. At least Richie was entertaining while being a douche, but Tina<br>
                was just an unpleasant individual.<br>
                Then, at the end of episode 4, almost all of that hatred is resolved within a single scene, making Tina respect<br>
                Sydney for her efforts and talent.<br>
                The fact that the show is able to do such a total switchup shows how well written it is.<br><br>
                I know that onetakes are a bit gimmicky, but it fits the episode in my opinion.
