        <h3>DoingNow</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a guy and am currently 18 years old (born 2006). <br>
            <br>
            I like coding as a hobby right now but don't know if I will like it as a job too.<br>
            For now, I'm doing some basic projects for the sake of creation (like this one).<br>
            <br>
            I also enjoy weightlifting and have been doing it for around 3 years now.<br>
            I recently started swimming, but I am still pretty bad at it. It's fun though. <br>
            <br>
            I like watching movies and shows, specifically the process of analysing and talking about them.<br>
            For more on that, read <a href="mediacritics.html">/mediacritics</a>. <br>
            <br>
            I started cooking a lot more for myself. Sometimes I enjoy the process of it, sometimes I don't.<br>
            I'm still in contact with my highschool friends, we meet up and do stuff occasionally.<br>
            <br>
            Other than that, I have trouble initiating social interactions with people, because I get pretty<br>
            scared of rejection. If the other person initiates or once I see that they're willing to talk to me,<br>
            the fear usually goes away. Still, this is something I want to work on.
