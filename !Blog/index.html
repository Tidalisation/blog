            <h3>About this Blog</h3>
            <p>Limbo Letters are supposed to be a written version of some of my thoughts regarding stuff that matters to me. <br>
                I hope you can relate to my blog to some degree. <br></p>
                <br>
            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>For the purpose of honesty and to eliminate the fear of being judged (which would lead to me hiding my deepest thoughts),<br>
                I have decided to remain anonymous for this blog. I think that my indentity isn't really of great importance when<br>
                it comes to understanding/relating to my blog, since they focus my experiences rather than my person. I will try not<br>
                to be relatable for the sake of it, but maybe you can still relate regardless, for whatever reason that may be. </p>
            <p>If you're still curious about what I am doing right now, feel free to read <a href="doingNow.html">/doingNow</a></p>

                <h3>Starting this blog, new state of living</h3>
                <p>This the first blog post I have ever made. Still, I want to spare you my hesitative thoughts regarding this, since - as you <br>
                can see - I did end up doing this. <br><br>
                When I described to ChatGPT what I was doing and asked it for a name, it gave me "limbo letters". Whether I end up sticking with it <br>
                or not, I think that it really fits my current state of living. Never in my life have I been so uncertain of what even the next month might<br>
                look like. All this thinking about the future has actually led to me feeling weirdly unpresent during a lot of the long awaited stuff that<br>
                I've looked forward to, like my graduation celebration or the trip to Spain with my friends, the first time in my life I've ever left my<br>
                home country. Now that both of these things are over, I end up looking back realizing how fast the time went, almost melancholically.<br>
                Even weirder is that during these things, instead of enjoying them for myself - right now - it felt like I was doing all of it to gather<br>
                memories and stories for my future self. <br><br>
                I think that we've been told so many times that <i>"you never know the good times until they are over"</i>, we actually end up compromising <br>
                our present experiences by trying to feel a sense of gratitude that <i>"these are the good times now and therefore I owe it to my future <br>
                self to enjoy them as much as I can, for I know that worse times will come"</i>. I think this leads to a sort of "performative joyfulness".<br><br>
                Trying to feel present in these moments makes them almost feel like a task that I have to check off. Maybe it's because I focus too much<br>
                on being present, because I do value that very much. Maybe I care too much about what future me will think of current me for not being<br>
                present. And right now, I am mad at past me for being mad at not being present and therefore being even less present. I feel mad to<br>
                have served only for the future and that I, as a tradeoff, missed out on the deeper experience, may that one have been less focused,<br>
                but much more authentic.<br><br>

                I think a better version of that first quote would be:<br><br>
                <i>"Bad times will come, but they are not here now, so don't feel obligated to enjoy the good times. <br> 
                    You'll understand the value of them during the bad ones."</i>
